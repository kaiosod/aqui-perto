# Project Name = Nearby (Aqui Perto)

Web application for locating nearby establishments and services, with a focus on simplicity, usability, and user experience (UX).

## 📌 Project Description

**Here Nearby** is a web application prototype that allows users to find nearby establishments — such as restaurants, pharmacies, and markets — based on their current location.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate that a **simple and minimalist interface**, grounded in usability principles, can provide a clearer and more efficient user experience compared to feature-heavy solutions.

This project was developed as part of a **Final Course Project (TCC)** in the field of Software Engineering.
